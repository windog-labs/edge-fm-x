# Triton Deep Reference

Repository: <https://github.com/triton-lang/triton>

Source-only policy: do not query PR notes for this repository unless the PR
corpus reaches at least 10 selected CUDA optimization PRs. Use this source
guide, the source catalog, and current source paths directly.

Use this when the user asks for Triton, the baseline is Triton or Inductor
generated code, or the target framework's hot kernel is written in Triton.

## Read Order

1. Tutorial closest to the operator.
2. Target framework's Triton kernel and wrapper.
3. Autotune key/config definitions.
4. Lowering/backend tests when SASS or scheduling is surprising.
5. Benchmark harness and p50/p90 reporting.

## Code Map

| Area | Paths to inspect |
| --- | --- |
| Tutorials | `python/tutorials/` |
| Language primitives | `python/triton/language/` |
| Runtime / autotune | `python/triton/runtime/` |
| Compiler lowering | `lib/`, `third_party/nvidia/` |
| Backend tests | `test/TritonGPU/`, `test/` |

## Search Patterns

```bash
rg -n "tl\\.dot|tl\\.load|tl\\.store|block_ptr|make_block_ptr|program_id|num_warps|num_stages|autotune|Config" python test
rg -n "TMA|warp_specialize|persistent|split_k|matmul|softmax|layer_norm|attention|moe" python test lib third_party/nvidia
```

## Candidate Use

- Triton code can seed candidates when the user or baseline calls for Triton.
- Record source path, commit, autotune config, compile flags, and first delta.
- Always include warmup and compile-time notes because Triton JIT effects can
  hide true kernel latency.

## NCU Focus

| Kernel family | First metrics |
| --- | --- |
| Matmul / attention | tensor pipe %, L2/DRAM bytes, occupancy, register pressure |
| Softmax / norm | DRAM throughput, global sectors, issue stalls |
| Persistent kernels | active cycles, load imbalance, launch/grid size, long scoreboard |
