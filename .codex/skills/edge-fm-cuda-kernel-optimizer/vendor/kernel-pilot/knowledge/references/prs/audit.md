## Source-Only Repositories

These repositories are excluded from PR documents and should be queried through source guides or current source trees. Repositories with fewer than 10 selected CUDA optimization PRs are also folded into this source-only set.

| Repository | Source reference | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pytorch/pytorch` | [`source`](../source-guides/pytorch.md) | PyTorch is too large/noisy for useful PR recall; use source guide and current source scan. |
| `deepseek-ai/TileKernels` | [`source`](../source-guides/tilekernels.md) | Little public PR history; use source guide and current source scan. |
| `NVIDIA/cuda-samples` | [`source`](../source-guides/cuda-blog-kernels.md) | Sample/code repository; PR history is not the optimization knowledge layer. |
| `NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples` | [`source`](../../../references/kernel-source-catalog.md) | Sample/code repository; PR history is not the optimization knowledge layer. |
| `NVIDIA/cudnn-frontend` | [`source`](../../../references/kernel-source-catalog.md) | Sample/API repository; use source/catalog references directly. |
| `NVIDIA/nvbench` | [`source`](../../../references/kernel-source-catalog.md) | Benchmark methodology repository; use source/catalog references directly. |
| `NVIDIA/cuda-tile` | [`source`](../../../references/kernel-source-catalog.md) | Experimental source repository; use source/catalog references directly. |

## Filter Policy

- Keep PRs only when they have CUDA/NVIDIA target evidence, a real kernel/source change, and an optimization/performance mechanism.
- Keep CUDA optimization PRs across the registered knowledge repositories, including implementation, runtime dispatch, tuning, benchmark-backed speed work, profiler evidence, and kernel-family feature additions.
- Filter obvious non-CUDA backend work such as MPS, ROCm, AMD-only, MUSA, Ascend, Intel, CPU-only, Metal, RVV, and RISC-V PRs unless the same PR also carries CUDA/NVIDIA kernel evidence.
- Filter release-only, CI-only, dependency-bump, formatting, copyright-header, MyPy, doc-only, cookbook-only, example-path-only, and correctness-only PRs.
- Keep major release PRs only when their changed paths expose real kernel/API source files and the title/body points to kernel features.

## Evidence Captured Per PR

- PR URL and stable source key, for example `vllm-project/vllm#42236`.
- Primary and secondary kernel categories.
- Changed-path buckets: kernel, benchmark, test, wrapper, docs, other.
- Short human-readable summary.
- Transfer recipe and first NCU metrics to inspect.
- Matched search queries in `pr-index.json` for traceability.

## Retrieval Strategy

1. Use the repository PR page and the matching source guide together when the baseline framework is PR-driven.
2. For source-only repositories, skip PR lookup and use the source guide or source catalog plus current source tree.
3. Use `by-topic/index.md` when the bottleneck category is known but the best source repository is not, then open source guides for every promising repository.
4. Use `open-watchlist.md` only for fresh ideas, and re-check GitHub plus the current source tree before trusting the code or benchmark claim.
5. Log every source-derived idea in `artifacts/source-idea-ledger.md` with PR key when available, source path or symbol, opened tests/benchmarks, hypothesis, result, and do-not-reread key.

## Known Gaps

- DeepSeek TileKernels has little public PR history, so source-guide and direct code scan are mandatory paired evidence for that repo.
- GitHub search can miss PRs whose titles and bodies use generic wording. When optimizing a specific kernel, still run path-based `gh pr list` or `gh search prs` for that exact file/function name and inspect current source paths.
- Open PR entries are intentionally volatile and should not be treated as merged production evidence.
- The corpus is intentionally CUDA-first. Non-CUDA backend PRs are filtered out unless they also contain CUDA/NVIDIA kernel evidence.
