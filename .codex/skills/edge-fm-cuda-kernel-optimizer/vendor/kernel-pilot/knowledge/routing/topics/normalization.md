# Topic: Normalization (RMSNorm / LayerNorm / QK-Norm)

## What it covers

Fused RMSNorm, LayerNorm, and their variants (QK-norm, fused-add-norm,
norm + quant). Almost always memory-bound.

## Common optimization patterns

- Per-row CTA with block reduction; vectorized loads (`float4`, `bfloat162`).
- Fuse `add(residual, x)` before the reduction to avoid a second pass.
- Fuse the post-norm quantization (FP8 / FP4) into the same kernel.
- QK-norm: a small reduction per head; can share warp-level reductions
  across heads if hidden dim is small.

## Common bottlenecks

- HBM bandwidth (always check `dram__throughput`).
- Bank conflicts in shared-memory reductions when using non-warp-friendly
  vector widths.
- Long-scoreboard stalls when the reduction is forced into multiple passes.

## Recommended ncu metrics

- `dram__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed`
- `l1tex__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed`
- `smsp__inst_executed.avg.per_cycle_active`
- `smsp__warp_issue_stalled_long_scoreboard.sum`
- `l1tex__data_bank_conflicts_pipe_lsu.sum`
